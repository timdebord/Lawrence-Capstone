# Abstract 

As the United States experiences an increasing number of disasters each year, the effects of climate change are becoming more evident. This paper examines the relationship between storm damage and homeowners insurance premiums. Using damage covered by homeowners insurance as the treatment variable, I applied a spatial error model that uses two-way state and year fixed effects to analyze its impact on premiums. The results indicate a small positive effect of covered storm damage on homeowners insurance premiums.

# Introduction 

Climate change is a looming threat that all of humanity faces together. In recent years, wildfires, hurricanes, and other deadly natural disasters have become more frequent. In 2024 alone, California was ablaze, while the Atlantic Ocean unleashed an unprecedented number of hurricanes on the United States East Coast. Scientific theory suggests that as global ocean surface temperatures rise, the number of tropical storms and hurricanes will also increase due to the Coriolis effect, which causes storms to rotate and influences their movement based on the Earth's rotation and wind patterns. These events leave destruction in their wake, often resulting in costly damages. As the risks of climate change grow, so should the cost of insurance that covers storm-related damage. Specifically, homeowners insurance premiums reflect an insurer’s perceived risk of insuring a client and the surrounding area. The higher the risk, the more premiums should rise. In my analysis I will look at storm data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to examine their effect on homeowners insurance premiums between 2008 and 2019 by using a spatial error panel model by maximum likelihood in R.  

Intuitively, I expect to find a positive significant relationship between damage covered by homeowners insurance and homeowners premiums. The more damage a state receives, the higher the amount insurance companies will have to pay in claims, and therefore, premiums should be higher to account for the risk of damage. Furthermore, the effect of damage not covered by homeowners insurance is less clear. If the damage is covered by a different type of insurance, I expect to see a negative effect on homeowners premiums due to the economic substitution effect. It is also reasonable to believe that there will be no effect, as the damage should hypothetically not impact homeowners premiums if it is excluded from how insurance companies calculate premiums. 

The existing literature supports the idea that homeowners insurance premiums are related to climate risk. In 2024, Benjamin J. Keys and Philip Mulder analyzed the relationship between property insurance and disaster risk and found that premiums have risen sharply since 2020, with this growth concentrated in disaster-prone ZIP codes (Keys et al., 2020). Keys and Mulder split their natural disaster risk variable into disaster risk and climate risk, and I used that idea as a basis for separating damage into coverable and non-coverable damage depending on the storm. Additionally, when accounting for socioeconomic status and demographic variables, they used the percentage of the population that is not white as an explanatory variable. Their reasoning was that lower-income areas see much higher premiums as a share of income, and ZIP codes with larger nonwhite population shares pay higher premiums even after controlling for disaster risk and income (Keys et al., 2020). 

Further, in 2012, Randy E. Dumm et al. tested the hypothesis of whether increases in insurance premiums serve as a risk signal and negatively impact house prices. Dumm et al. found a negative and significant relationship between insurance premiums and house prices in each regression (Dumm et al., 2012). Dumm et al.’s use of home prices helped me decide between the importance of average home prices and median household income, and I ultimately chose the former. Additionally, their findings provided intuition behind the relationship between home prices and premium prices. In high-risk areas, they found that places with historically high damage had reductions in home prices but still had to pay higher premiums. 

# Data

The data in this paper merges information from four different sources: the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), KFF, and Zillow. After dropping Alaska and Hawaii, the final spatial panel dataset includes 48 states from 2008 to 2019, totaling 576 observations across 224 variables. It also contains spatial polygons for each state, allowing me to analyze the spatial relationships between homeowners insurance premiums and storm damage. Table 1 presents the first five rows of the dataset, highlighting the key variables used in my analysis: homeowners insurance premiums, total home damage, total natural disaster damage, average home price, percentage of the population that is white, and population density.  

```{r, include=TRUE, tab.cap = "Selected variables fromt he first 5 rows in the dataset"}
# Function to round numeric columns to 2 decimal places
round_df <- function(df, digits) {
  df %>% mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~ round(., digits)))
}

# Assume your data frame is named 'model_ready'
# Extract the variables of interest
vars_of_interest <- model_ready[, c("State" , "Year", "homePrems", "home_damage", "disaster_damage", "AvgHomePrice", "Percent_white", "PopDensity")]

vars_of_interest <- vars_of_interest %>%
  rename(
    "Home Premiums" = homePrems,
    "Home Damage" = home_damage,
    "Disaster Damage" = disaster_damage,
    "Percent White" = Percent_white,
    "Avg Home Price" = AvgHomePrice
  )

# Round the numeric columns to 2 decimal places
vars_of_interest <- round_df(vars_of_interest, 2)

# Show the first 5 rows
table <- head(vars_of_interest, 5)

  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "hold_position", "scale_down")) %>%

```

Looking at Table 1, the geometry variable provides the dataset with its spatial attributes. The NOAA dataset includes every storm recorded in the United States between 1950 and 2024. After filtering to keep only storms that occurred between 2008 and 2019, each row either contained a latitude and longitude coordinate for a storm or had a missing value. To address this, I used a shapefile from the Census Bureau that provided polygon data for each state and merged each storm with the state in which it was recorded. This effectively transformed the spatial data from point data to polygon data, aligning it with the rest of my dataset, which is at the state level. For storms that affected multiple states, each state recorded the event and reflected the corresponding storm data. After restructuring the dataset, I was able to create the damage variables. Home damage represents damage caused by storms typically covered by homeowners insurance, including tornadoes, excessive heat, heavy snow, high winds, hail, winter storms, blizzards, ice storms, strong winds, and lightning. Disaster damage includes damage from events that are generally not covered by homeowners insurance and may require specialized coverage, such as hurricanes, floods, flash floods, storm surges, wildfires, coastal floods, lakeshore floods, and tsunamis. I separated these damage types because damage typically covered by homeowners insurance should explain some of the variation in insurance premiums, while damage that falls outside standard coverage may have a less direct impact on pricing have hit that region over 2008 and 2019. Looking at the left map in Figure 1, we can see that areas like Tornado Alley experience more damage than regions that do not frequently experience tornadoes. However, the overall distribution of home damage is well-varied, with no extreme outliers. When examining disaster damage, a different pattern emerges. Florida, Louisiana, and especially Texas have sustained significantly more damage than the rest of the country. This is largely due to the devastating hurricanes that struck these regions between 2008 and 2019. 

```{r, include=TRUE, fig.cap= "Left map shows home damage, right shows disaster damage"}
# Aggregate the total damage by state while keeping geometry
state_damage_2 <- model_ready %>%
  group_by(State) %>%
  summarise(home_damage = sum(home_damage, na.rm = TRUE), 
            disaster_damage = sum(disaster_damage, na.rm = TRUE),
            actual_NRI = sum(actual_NRI, na.rm = TRUE),
            geometry = st_union(geometry)) %>%
  ungroup()

# Convert leaflet map to a static tmap
tm_shape(state_damage_2) +
  tm_polygons("home_damage", 
              title = "Total Home Damage",
              palette = "YlOrRd",
              style = "quantile",
              n = 8) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Home Damage by State") -> homedamageplot

tm_shape(state_damage_2) +
  tm_polygons("disaster_damage", 
              title = "Total Disaster Damage",
              palette = "YlOrRd",
              style = "quantile",
              n = 8) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Disaster Damage by State") -> disasterdamageplot

tmap_arrange(homedamageplot, disasterdamageplot, ncol = 2)

```

Storms in the United States have historically been classified into nine climate regions: Northeast, Upper Midwest, Ohio Valley, Southeast, Northern Rockies and Plains, South, Southwest, Northwest, and West. Although premiums are not determined at the regional level, states within the same region experience similar risks and hypothetically should have comparable premium prices. I will use regions as a potential fixed effect rather than state fixed effects, which will be further detailed in the methods section. Below, in Figure 2, the left map from NOAA displays the defined climate regions, while the right map shows the average homeowners insurance premiums from 2008 to 2019. Comparing the two maps reveals that the South region, on average, has the highest premiums, suggesting that the idea of regions sharing similar premiums due to regional risk is not unreasonable. 

```{r, include=TRUE, fig.cap = "Left map shows regions while right map shows homeowners premiums"}
# Aggregate the total damage by state while keeping geometry
state_damage <- model_ready %>%
  group_by(State) %>%
  summarise(homePrems = mean(homePrems, na.rm = TRUE),
            geometry = st_union(geometry)) %>%
  ungroup()

# Create a static map using tmap
homePrems_map <- tm_shape(state_damage) +
  tm_polygons("homePrems",
              title = "Homeowner Premiums",
              palette = "YlOrRd",
              style = "quantile",
              n=8) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Average Homeowner Premiums by State")

# Save the map as a PNG file
tmap_save(homePrems_map, "homePrems_map.png")

# Read the saved map image
homePrems_map_img <- readPNG("homePrems_map.png")

# Read the image from the local file
image_path <- "C:/Users/timmy/Desktop/School Files/Capstone/Screenshot 2025-02-27 115258.png"  # Correct file path
img <- readPNG(image_path)

# Create the plot grid: map on the left, image on the right
grid.arrange(rasterGrob(img),rasterGrob(homePrems_map_img), ncol = 1)
```

In addition, the other control variables include the percentage of the population that is white, population density, and average home price. The percentage of the population that is white comes from KFF, formerly known as the Kaiser Family Foundation. This variable helps control for potential racial disparities in insurance pricing, whether due to discrimination or coincidental factors, both of which could influence homeowners insurance premiums. Population density is calculated by dividing the total number of residents in each state by the state’s area in square miles, using data from KFF and the Census Bureau. Accounting for each state's population density should impact home insurance because, in densely populated areas, insurance companies have a larger pool of policyholders, which helps distribute risk. Conversely, in less densely populated areas, the risk pool is smaller, meaning premiums may be higher to compensate for the increased financial exposure per policyholder. Finally, the last control variable is average home price, which I got from Zillow. The average home price should directly impact homeowners insurance premiums since the higher the property value, the more there is for an insurance company to cover under a single policy, leading to higher premiums. 

# Methodology 

The main goal of this paper is to examine the spatial relationship between homeowners insurance premiums and storm damage. To do that, we first need to test whether an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression shows evidence of spatial autocorrelation. From there, we have to define the neighbors and weights of the model, which will allow us to incorporate a spatial element into the calculations. Once that’s set up, we can build the final model using the spml function from the splm package in R. 

To test the OLS regression for spatial autocorrelation, I used a Moran’s I test and a Lagrange multiplier test on the OLS output. Spatial autocorrelation measures the degree to which values of a variable at nearby locations are correlated. The null hypothesis of the Moran’s I test was that there was no spatial autocorrelation. However, since the I value was significant, there was evidence of spatial autocorrelation. Additionally, using the Lagrange multiplier test for fixed effects, I found evidence for both spatial lag and spatial error. (The regression results for the OLS and  fixed effects models, along with the test results, are included in the appendix.) Evidence of a spatial lag suggested that homeowners insurance premiums in one state influenced premiums in neighboring states. Meanwhile, evidence of spatial error indicated that the error terms were not independently and identically distributed, violating the normality assumption of an OLS model. However, despite both the lag and error tests being significant, I chose a spatial error model as it best fit my research question. 

As stated in the data section, I transformed the geometry from points representing latitude and longitude to polygons representing states. This allows my model to fully utilize the state-level data I’ve collected while maintaining spatial information. Using these polygons, I can create a neighbors matrix that feeds into an equation to generate the spatial weights required for the model. I chose to combine two different methods to construct the neighbors matrix. 

The first method is distance-based neighboring, where neighbors are determined by measuring the physical distance between points. In this paper, I used the centroid—the center point of a polygon—as the reference point. If a centroid falls within the radius of another centroid, the two states are considered neighbors. However, if a polygon itself falls within the radius but its centroid does not, they are not neighbors. This distinction is illustrated in the appendix. In Figure 3, we see the results of using only a radius of 525 kilometers to calculate the neighbors matrix. While the East Coast appears to be accounted for appropriately, issues arise further west. To address this, I incorporate another method to refine the neighbors matrix. 

```{r, include = TRUE, warning = FALSE, fig.cap="Map of neighbors with only distance-based neighboring"}
nb <- model_ready %>%
  filter(Year %in% c(2011))

centroids <- st_centroid(nb)  # This should already be in 'sf' format

centroids_sp <- as(centroids, "Spatial")

dist_matrix <- spDists(centroids_sp)
# First, create a circle around each centroid
circle_radius <- 525  # Your specified distance threshold
buffer <- st_buffer(centroids, dist = circle_radius)

neighbors <- dnearneigh(centroids_sp, 0, 525)

# Plot everything in the correct order
plot(st_geometry(nb), border = "black")  # Original polygons
plot(buffer, add = TRUE, col = "transparent", border = "red", lty = 2, density = 50)  # Distance circles
plot(neighbors, st_coordinates(st_centroid(st_geometry(nb))), add = TRUE, 
     col = "blue", lwd = 1.5)  # Neighbor connections
```

The second method is rook contiguity, where two states are considered neighbors if they share a side—similar to the movement of a rook in chess. If I had also allowed states sharing only a vertex to be neighbors, this would be called queen contiguity. For a visual reference, see the appendix. In Figure 4, we see the result of combining both methods, which I believe best represents the United States. This approach properly accounts for clustering in the Northeast while also ensuring that larger states are correctly assigned neighbors. 

```{r, include = TRUE, warning = FALSE, fig.cap= "Complete neighbor map using both distance-based neighbors and rook contiguity"}
nb <- model_ready %>%
  filter(Year %in% c(2011))

centroids <- st_centroid(nb)  # This should already be in 'sf' format

centroids_sp <- as(centroids, "Spatial")

dist_matrix <- spDists(centroids_sp)

# Create neighbors list
neighbors <- dnearneigh(centroids_sp, 0, 525)

# Define row indices for California, Arizona, and Oregon
california_index <- 4L  # Ensure it's an integer
arizona_index <- 2L
oregon_index <- 35L

neighbors[[california_index]] <- sort(unique(as.integer(c(neighbors[[california_index]], arizona_index, oregon_index))))

The neighbors matrix alone isn’t enough for the model to account for the spatial nature of the data, so I also needed to specify a weight matrix to incorporate spatial weights. A spatial weight quantifies the relationship between neighbors based on their proximity or connectivity, defining how much influence one unit has on another in a spatial analysis. The most common approach is to assign equal weights by dividing 1 by the total number of neighbors a polygon has (the equation is provided in the appendix). However, this method doesn’t make sense when using distance-based neighbors. For example, New Jersey’s effect on New York shouldn’t be the same as its effect on West Virginia. To better capture this relationship, I use an inverse distance weight matrix, which penalizes states that are farther from the base neighbor while also accounting for the number of neighbors a state has. This ensures that the model receives a weighted matrix that more accurately reflects the spatial relationships across the United States. 

With the spatial weights defined, the only decision left before building the final model is the functional form of each variable. All damage variables and population density will be logged to address outliers and scale differences compared to the other variables. The graphs showing both logged and unlogged versions of these variables can be found in the appendix. The remaining variables will be kept in their original forms. I considered scaling the data due to the large differences in magnitude but ultimately decided against it for interpretability’s sake. 

The final model is a spatial panel model by maximum likelihood (spml) from the splm package in R. Using a spml allows me to specify the weights, lags, errors, and effects for the model. Given my research question about the relationship between homeowners insurance premiums and storm damage, the spml is specified as a spatial error model, as I am not interested in analyzing the effect of a state’s premiums on nearby states' premiums. The inverse distance weighted matrix will be used to measure spatial relationships. After indexing the data by state and year to capture the panel aspect of the data, I need to decide between random effects and fixed effects. Random effects should be used if the variable needs to be controlled for to remove its influence, while fixed effects should be used if the variable should influence the response. I expect state and year to influence homeowners insurance premiums because state characteristics that do not change over time should have some unobserved effect on premiums, and the year should capture shocks that affect all states. 

Further, I compared four different fixed effects models using home damage covered by home insurance premiums as the treatment variable. Each model contained the same explanatory variables to determine the best final model. Fixed effects demean the data, allowing us to measure the effect of the variables relative to the fixed effects mean rather than just their direct impact. State fixed effects, used in Model 1, control for unobserved characteristics within a state that do not change over time. An example of a constant characteristic is a state’s location on the coast or in Tornado Alley, both of which lead to higher premiums due to increased risk of damage.  Model 2 applies year fixed effects, which account for unobservable shocks affecting all states equally over time. A combination of state and year fixed effects controls for both state-specific and time-specific unobservables. Region fixed effects function similarly to state fixed effects but apply to larger geographic areas. However, because regions include more diverse states, it’s harder to assume that unobserved factors remain constant within each region over time. Given this limitation, the final model will use state and year fixed effects. In my analysis, I will compare all fixed effects models to evaluate how they account for unobserved factors and influence the results. 

When specifying the spml model in R to create a spatial error model, you can choose between the `b` (Baltagi) or `kkp` (Kapoor) methods. For my final model, I am using the Baltagi method because it accounts for spatially correlated errors while ensuring robust estimation (Baltagi 2007). This approach is particularly well-suited for panel data with both spatial and temporal dimensions, making it a strong fit for my model, which includes state and year fixed effects. The Baltagi method relies on a quasi-maximum likelihood estimator (QMLE) to estimate spatial autoregressive parameters, capturing spatial spillover effects where errors from neighboring observations influence each other (Yang 2013). This leads to more reliable estimates. On the other hand, the `kkp` method assumes homoskedasticity—equal variances across states—in the error term and relies on a generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator (Kapoor 2007). While GMM can help address cross-sectional dependence, it may lose efficiency in small samples and does not fully account for heteroskedasticity (when variance is not constant) or spatial dependencies in panel data with fixed effects (Moscone 2011). That being said, the choice between `b` and `kkp` does not impact my results, as shown in the appendix, where I re-estimate all four models using the `kkp` error method. 

The final model is a spatial error model that includes state and year fixed effects. Epsilon_it is a vector of spatially autocorrelated innovations that follow a spatial autoregressive process (Millo et al. 2012). The Kronecker product of the identity matrix I_T (which represents the time dimension) and the spatial weights matrix W_N (which describes the spatial neighbors). This term ensures that the spatial weights are applied at each year for each state. The spatial autoregressive parameter, rho, captures the strength of spatial dependence between state i and state j while being restricted to be between negative one and positive one. Alpha_i represents the state fixed effect, while alpha_t represents the year fixed effect. Nu_it is the independent error term that is uncorrelated with the spatial error term. It captures any error that is random and not influenced by spatial factors.

\begin{split}
\textrm{homePrems}_{it} &= \alpha_i + \alpha_t + \beta_1 \log(\textrm{home damage}_{it}) + \beta_2 \log(\textrm{disaster damage}_{it}) + \beta_3 \log(\textrm{AvgHomePrice}_{it}) \\
&{} + \beta_4 \log(\textrm{Percent white}_{it}) + \beta_5 \log(\textrm{PopDensity}_{it}) + \epsilon_{it}, \\

&\nu_{it} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2_{\nu}), \quad \epsilon_{it} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2_{\epsilon}).

# Results

First, let's examine the results from different fixed effects models using home damage covered by insurance as the treatment variable. The state fixed effects model produces the smallest coefficient (0.947) and is the only statistically insignificant coefficient for home damage, suggesting that controlling only for time-invariant differences across states does not fully capture the effect of home damage. The year fixed effects model, on the other hand, yields the largest coefficient (4.497) and the most statistically significant result. However, a larger coefficient is not a legitimate method to determine a better fit, as this model only accounts for common shocks affecting all states and ignores unobserved differences between states. It is likely that the larger coefficient is due to an overestimated, biased model. Introducing region and year fixed effects partially addresses this issue, reducing the coefficient to 3.438 while maintaining statistical significance, though to a lesser degree. Controlling for regions helps account for some unobserved heterogeneity between states, but this assumes states within the same region share identical insurance markets or policy implementation, which is incorrect. Therefore, this approach may still produce an overestimated, biased coefficient. This concern is confirmed when applying state and year fixed effects, which yield a statistically significant coefficient of 1.302. Given the theoretical reasoning behind fixed effects and my research question, controlling for both state and year fixed effects ensures that coefficients reflect within-state variation over time while accounting for nationwide shocks that effect all states equally. For this reason, I will use this model to analyze the rest of the variables.

Upon examining the final model, we see the expected result of damage that should be covered by home insurance to have a positive statistically significant effect on the price of homeowners premiums. Specifically, when controlling for damage that is not covered by home insurance, average home price, percent white, and population density, for every 10 percent increase of damage that would be covered by home insurance, we expect to see a 0.13 dollar increase in home insurance premiums on average. Although this is not a large monetary value, it does show that there is an effect from storms on premium prices.  

Further, the only other statistically significant coefficient is percent white, which has a negative effect on home premiums. Specifically, for every one percent increase in the white population, homeowners premiums are expected to decrease by 4.67 dollars on average. This finding suggests that racial bias could be a factor, with non-white populations potentially facing higher premiums. However, while discrimination is illegal, it is not impossible. More likely, this result reflects income and wealth disparities or lower credit scores. Coastal states tend to have more diverse populations but also face higher risks of damage and increased demand for coastal living, which could explain why areas with lower percentages of white residents have higher premiums on average.  

Population density, average home price, and damage not covered by home insurance are all not statistically significant. Despite being significant under year and region fixed effects, population density having a p-value of 1 suggests virtually no variation within a specific state over time. This is not surprising, as population growth rates across states are generally similar. At first glance, the lack of a statistically significant result for average home price may seem unexpected. However, after demeaning the data, the rate of change in average home price within a given state over time is likely uniform, reducing the likelihood of statistical significance. Lastly, the insignificance of damage not covered by homeowners insurance is expected, as I explicitly separated damage variables into those that should influence premiums and those that should not. The model finds no evidence of a relationship between uncovered damage and homeowners insurance premiums. 

Further, to visualize the relationships between the explanatory variables and homeowners premiums, I will use partial dependency graphs, as shown in Figure 5. A partial dependency graph holds all the other explanatory variables at their means, except for the explanatory variable of interest for that specific graph.

Percent white has by far the largest effect, showing an approximate total effect of 400 dollars on premiums, holding the other explanatory variables constant. In contrast, population density only affects premiums by approximately a dollar. Disaster damage, which is negatively correlated with the price of premiums, could reflect the need for an additional insurance plan, such as flood or hurricane insurance, leading to reduced premiums. However, since disaster damage is insignificant, there is no clear relationship, suggesting that disaster damage does not affect premiums. The positive effect of average home price on premiums makes intuitive sense, but it is also statistically insignificant, suggesting no evidence of a relationship between average home price and homeowners insurance premiums. As previously mentioned, this finding is likely due to the uniform increase in home prices across the United States. Damage covered by home insurance has a statistically significant positive effect on premiums, approximately 50 dollars. Although this effect is small compared to percent white, it adds up when considering the increase in average premiums across all homeowners in a state. 

# Conclusion 

Using a spatial error panel model by maximum likelihood while controlling for state and year fixed effects best fits the data and my research question of whether there is a positive statistically significant relationship between homeowners insurance premiums and damage caused by storms between 2008 and 2019. The results provide evidence of a positive relationship. With the growing literature on the increasing risks from climate change, policymakers should focus on ways to reduce the costs homeowners face and find solutions to mitigate the effects of climate change. Areas like California are becoming too risky to insure, leading insurance companies to pull their services from the state. Steps need to be taken to ensure that people in high-risk areas can access affordable homeowners insurance. 

The results I found align with my intuitive expectations, but these results are not causal. Lack of access to county-level data limits the accuracy of the estimates, and not having data on reinsurance rates also affects the analysis. Reinsurance, often referred to as insurance for insurance companies, significantly impacts premium prices (Investopedia). Omitting this variable weakens the causal claims this paper can make, but I expect to find similar results with its inclusion.
